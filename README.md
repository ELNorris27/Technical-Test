# Technical-Test for Junior UI Developer Role
This is a simple webpage that I created to closely resemble a Figma file that I was given as a visual example. I attempted to re-create the image using clean, semantic HTML, CSS, and a tiny sprinkle of JavaScript. Assets such as images and icons were included for import within the original Figma file.
